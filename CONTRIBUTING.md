# Contributing

Contribution is pretty simple. BugWorld prefers that you submit
changes using a forking workflow. For this, you will need a GitHub
account. The basic workflow for contributing is outlined below.

## Steps

1. Fork BugWorld into your own GitHub profile. You should
now have a github.com/yourusername/BugWorld.git repository.

2. Clone your forked repo onto your local machine, and
create an appropriately named branch for your new feature
or fix. Make your code changes and commit to this new branch.

3. Push your new branch to __your__ remote forked repo, located
at github.com/yourusername/BugWorld.git.

4. Finally, use the "submit pull request" feature on GitHub to
request that BugWorld pull your branch. Please make sure you write
a good description, including all relevant information regarding
changes you made and tests you performed.
