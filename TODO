BUGWORLD BUGS (hah)
___________________

+ sometimes the abort_game() function screws up the terminal
	- it has something to do with the stacktrace code
+ pthreads + ncurses interaction is buggy as all hell
	- animation timings on pthreads backend are really buggy,
	  see the player sprite updates vs the environ updates
		+ turns out this is due to unsigned subtraction errors
		  in the frame_time calculation, see FIXMEs
