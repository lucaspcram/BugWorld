TODO LIST FOR BUGWORLD
______________________

+ the play state
	- code the individual game components/logic (player, ants, water, etc)

+ the scores state
	- how to actually display the scores in a nice way (UX)

+ the help state
	- best way to explain the game/controls?
	- good UX?

+ gameobjs
	- nothing for now
	
+ 2D Perlin noise world generation
	- implement the Perlin noise alg in perlin.c

+ SIGALRM - pthreads migration
	- pthreads + ncurses is realllly buggy, they are not compat,
	  ncurses is not threadsafe, different terminals do crazy things
	- perhaps implement a way to optionally compile to use
	  pthreads/nanosleep OR the SIGALRM solution
	- or maybe make it a runtime configurable setting?

+ misc. refactoring and cleanup
	- defense/DRY design
	- 80 column soft limit (with tabstop=4)
	- readable, useful comments
	- write more robust tests


BUGWORLD BUGS (hah)
___________________

+ sometimes the abort_game() function screws up the terminal
	- it has something to do with the stacktrace code
+ pthreads + ncurses interaction is buggy as all hell
	- perhaps the SIGALRM solution is better?
