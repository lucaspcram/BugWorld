TODO LIST FOR BUGWORLD
______________________

+ the play state
	- code the individual game components/logic (player, ants, water, etc)
	- tweak map generation as we go (Perlin params)

+ the scores state
	- how to actually display the scores in a nice way (UX)

+ the help state
	- best way to explain the game/controls?
	- good UX?

+ misc. refactoring and cleanup
	- defensive/DRY design
	- 80 column soft limit
	- useful comments (C style, header explanation, impl WHY not WHAT)
	- write more robust tests
	- const pointer params to functions that don't change the param
	- order local variables
	- access functions should be (col,row) not (row,col)
	- change macro constants to static variables if possible


BUGWORLD BUGS (hah)

+ sometimes the abort_game() function screws up the terminal
	- it has something to do with the stacktrace code
